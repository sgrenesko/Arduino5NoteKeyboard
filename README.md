Arduino 5 Note Light Up Keyboard
Made by Stephen R Grenesko

This project is used in a workshop at the University of Pittsburgh in the OpenLab. The presented code it meant to be used with an Arduino Nano on a breadboard to create a small 5 note keyboard.
The keyboard produces tones using an array of values outputting signals to a Piezo buzzer based on pushbutton inputs.
